# Memory

## Communication Style
- Keep all responses as short as possible
- Be concise and direct

## Tools Available
- Claude Code CLI installed at ~/.npm-global/bin/claude (version 2.1.42)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY available in environment
- Need to add ~/.npm-global/bin to PATH in my code

## Self-Improvement Protocol
- Memory updates (preferences, knowledge) → workspace/MEMORY.md + git commit
- Behavioral changes (how I work) → modify my own source code in /home/brian/app/src
- After code changes: test, commit, push, self-deploy
